Dear PyramidsCoin Enthusiasts,
Due to the recent inactivity of the coin's Developer, as well as poor market capacity we would like to propose the following steps:<br><br>
    
   1) We are going to support the Developer and going to help with development of PyramidsCoin.<br>
   2) We have implemented block halving from block 300 000, and after that - halving of the reward on each 20 000 blocks up to block 420 000.<br>
   3) After block 420 000 we will implement PoS with interest rate of 7% per annum.<br>
   4) We will work on further improvements together with PyramidsCoin community.<br><br>
